I used these two commands to update the existing softwares on the ubuntu machine
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

then i went into the ssh folder and changed the ssh port from 22 to 2200 in the sshd_config file, I then froceeded to modify the firwall settings to allow myself to login through ssh
